# Motivation

I have always been fascinated by the potential of open-source tools interaction, 
among which `R` (long live `R`!) and lately Arduino.

For those who don't know, **Arduino** is an open-source hardware and software company
which designs and produces microcontroller kits for the deployment of digital services, 
both at a professional, hobby and educational level. Furthermore, the community is
very active and smart.

[**Here**](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/){target="_blank"} you can find many projects,
including Home Automation, Robotics and even more.

To me as a data scientist with a statistical background, electronics is a black box, for
this reason I chose to a 99% plug-and-play solution: Arduino Opl√† IoT Kit.

If you want to know more, here's a video introducing you the kit:

The kit comes with 4 integrated sensor measuring **Humidity**, **Pressure**, 
**Temperature** and **Light**.

Starting to collect data from these sensor is very simple: you just need to deploy 
an appropriate _sketch_ to the mother board, which can be done through the dedicated IDE or a
guided procedure.

Once everything is set up, you will have data flowing from sensors to the cloud and
visibile via a dashboard hosted on [**Arduino Cloud**](https://create.arduino.cc/iot/){target="_blank"},
free for 12 months with the kit purchase.

 you can access mine to have an idea.

**Data are stored into a cloud database and retrival of data is possible throught an API
which can be queried, guess what...**

# Project setup

The `R` ecosystem is constantly growing, adding new amazing productive tools such as 
[**Workflowr**](https://workflowr.github.io/workflowr/){target="_blank"} and
[**Flexdashboard**](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/){target="_blank"}, which
perfectly exploit [**Github actions**](https://github.com/features/actions){target="_blank"}
in order to automatize their scope.

Furthermore, in order to make it easier to access [**Arduino Iot Cloud API **](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/iot/api/){target="_blank"}, I developed an 
`R` package through [**pkgdown**](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/){target="_blank"}.
The package is called [**Rduinoiot**](https://flavioleccese92.github.io/Rduinoiot/){target="_blank"} and can be found on `CRAN`.
