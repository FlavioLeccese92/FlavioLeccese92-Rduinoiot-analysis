# Motivation

I have always been fascinated by the potential of open-source tools interaction, 
among which `R` (long live `R`!) and lately Arduino.

For those who don't know, **Arduino** is an open-source hardware and software company
which designs and produces microcontroller kits for the deployment of digital services, 
both at a professional, hobby and educational level. Furthermore, the community is
very active and smart.

[**Here**](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/){target="_blank"} you can find many projects,
including Home Automation, Robotics and even more.

<div style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">

</div>

To me as a data scientist with a statistical background, electronics is a black box, for
this reason I chose to a 99% plug-and-play solution: Arduino Opl√† IoT Kit.

If you want to know more, here's a video introducing you the kit:

<div style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/livKtMZQMS8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="margin: 0 auto; display: block"></iframe>
</div>

The kit comes with 4 integrated sensor measuring **Humidity**, **Pressure**, 
**Temperature** and **Light**.

Starting to collect data from these sensor is very simple: you just need to deploy 
an appropriate _sketch_ to the mother board, which can be done through the dedicated IDE or a
guided procedure.

Once everything is set up, you will have data flowing from sensors to the cloud and
visibile via a dashboard hosted on [**Arduino Cloud**](https://create.arduino.cc/iot/){target="_blank"},
free for 12 months with the kit purchase.
[**Here**](https://create.arduino.cc/iot/dashboards/9d492935-cf9c-4947-83f9-f9426ac1d20b/){target="_blank"}
 you can access mine to have an idea.

Data are stored into a cloud database and retrival of data is possible throught an API
which can be queried, guess what...

<center><font size="5">**with `R`!**</font></center>

# Goal

> The goal of the project is to deploy a dashboard on github which shows Arduino sensor
data and it is updated every 15 minutes. Documentation (and this very document you are
reading) must automatically versionised at every commit and every version easily 
accessible. Every software used must be for free.

# Project setup

The `R` ecosystem is constantly growing, adding new amazing productive tools such as 
[**Workflowr**](https://workflowr.github.io/workflowr/){target="_blank"} and
[**Flexdashboard**](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/){target="_blank"}, which
perfectly exploit [**Github actions**](https://github.com/features/actions/){target="_blank"}
in order to automatize their scope.

Furthermore, in order to make it easier to access [**Arduino Iot Cloud API **](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/iot/api/){target="_blank"}, I developed an 
`R` package through [**pkgdown**](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/){target="_blank"}.
The package is called [**Rduinoiot**](https://flavioleccese92.github.io/Rduinoiot/){target="_blank"} and can be found on `CRAN`.

<div style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
![](images/environment-setup.png)
</div>

# Workflowr
[**Workflowr**](https://workflowr.github.io/workflowr/){target="_blank"} is an `R` 
package that supports you in creating an **organized**, **reproducible** and **shareable**
project on **Github** or **Gitlab**.

Practically speaking, when opening RStudio to start a new project, if you
have Worflowr installed, you will see a new option. By chosing it, you are creating
automatically a git-versioned project with organized subdirectories. 

To tell Worflowr which git account to use, run the function:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
wflow_git_config(user.name = "Full Name", user.email = "email@domain")
```

Then you can create `rmarkdown` analyses and make them accessible by a customizable
website hosted for free on **Github** or **Gitlab**.

The two type of files relevant for a workflowr site are `*.Rmd`s and `_site.yml`.

## Analysis files `*.Rmd`

Any type of `rmarkdown` file can be added to your site. Only restriction, of course, 
is that your files cannot be `shiny` markdowns since they need a server to process
live user interactions and in our setup we do not have it, so avoid `runtime: shiny`.
`rmarkdown` files are static html and usually not optimal for reporting analysis of 
data which require frequent updates.
Additionally, for my porpuse an ordinary markdown would not have satisfied my graphical
obsession.

For these two reasons, I decided to go with `flexdashboard` (to obtain a catchy but
static report) + `github actions` (to update the static HTML with new data every 15 
minutes). But we will talk about it later in this document.

The most important part of the `rmarkdown` is the **header**, which will be automatically
generated by workflowr and is customizable:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
---
title: "Using R to visualize Arduino-iot weather sensor data"
site: workflowr::wflow_site
output:
  workflowr::wflow_html:
    toc: true
    toc_float: yes
    theme: flatly
    highlight: textmate
    css: style.css
editor_options:
  chunk_output_type: console
---
```

Analysis files `*.Rmd` need to be stored under `analysis/` folder.

Once you are done with your analysis, you can build your site locally:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
wflow_build()
```

If not specified, `workflowr` will add to the local site each of your analysis in 
the `analysis/` folder.

Then, if you are ready to put it online, simply choose which analysis you want to
publish and run the following:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
wflow_publish(c("analysis/index.Rmd", "analysis/license.Rmd"))
```

This creates a commit and at the next push git will trigger the action to build the
site.

The last step to have our site online is to go on our Git (in this case, **Github**)
project, go to *Settings* > *Pages* and under *Source*, select `Deploy from branch`.
Then select `main` and as a folder `/docs` and save.

<div style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
![](images/github-pages.png)
</div>

## Structure site file `_site.yml`

The design of the site which will host analysis is defined by the `_site.yml`.

The most important things you can customize are the **theme**, the **navigation bar**, 
which **analysis** has to be shown and where (and any HTML file too) and the **footer**.
[**Here**](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowrBeta/articles/wflow-02-customization.html){target="_blank"}
you can find more information.

While I am writing this document, the `_site.yml` of this site is the following:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
name: "Rduinoiot-analysis"
output_dir: ../docs
navbar:
  title: "Rduinoiot-analysis"
  left:
  - text: Home
    href: index.html
  - text: Weather report
    href: weather-report.html
  - text: License
    href: license.html
output:
  workflowr::wflow_html:
    toc: true
    toc_float: yes
    theme: flatly
    highlight: textmate
    css: style.css
editor_options:
  chunk_output_type: console
```

A `style.css` file is stored under subdirectory */docs* for additional graphical customization. 

# Flexdashboard
[**Flexdashboard**](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/){target="_blank"} is an `R` package 
which allows to easily develop dashboards as you were writing a simple `rmarkdown` document.

I confess that I always had prefered `Shiny apps` for their interactivity, but they require
a server and the graphical needs of my app exceeded the RAM constraint of [**shinyapps.io**](https://www.shinyapps.io/){target="_blank"} free plan.

However, even if not real time and without user interaction, refreshing the `flexdashboard`
with new data driven by free `github actions` did the trick. Furthermore, having 
analysis together with documentation in a `workflowr` site seemed pretty cool.

<div style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
![](images/weather-report.png)
</div>

As usual, creating a `flexdashboard` is straight-forward: if you have the package 
installed, in **Rstudio** choose new *R Markdown...* > *From template* > *Flex dashboard*.
Again, the header is very important and you will note that, when comparing with 
the `workflowr` earlied showed, you will see:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
---
...
output: 
  flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:
...
---
```

You can customize this dashboard seemengly to the common `rmarkdown` documents.
If you want to have an idea, give a look at the
[file](https://github.com/FlavioLeccese92/Rduinoiot-analysis/blob/main/dashboard/weather-report.Rmd){target="_blank"}
which generates the **Weather report** analysis from my Arduino's sensors. The file 
is stored under subdirectory */dashboard*.

# Github actions

The last piece we need to get everything working is to automatize our scripts, 
in order to have the dashboard updated every 15 minutes with fresh new data from 
Arduino. In order to do that, we use
[**Github actions**](https://github.com/features/actions){target="_blank"}!

We would want to automatize two **jobs**:

## 1. `refresh-data.R`

As you expect, this `R` script is in charge of getting new data
from Arduino. It reads the old data and starting from the most recent data timestamp
loop over sensors until current time. Then it overwrites the old dataset with a new
`.rds` under the subdirectory */data*.

Packages used are: [**Rduinoiot**](https://flavioleccese92.github.io/Rduinoiot/){target="_blank"},
[**tibble**](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"},
[**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"} and
[**lubridate**](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}.

## 2. `deploy-dashboard.R`

This other `R` script makes sure that a new **flexdashboard**
is created and moved under the subdirectory *docs* where `workflowr` site is built.
In doing that we are mapping the dashboard right inside the documentation site!

Package used is [**rmarkdown**](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"}.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(rmarkdown)
render("dashboard/weather-report.Rmd")
file.rename("dashboard/weather-report.html", "docs/weather-report.html")
```

Both files are stored under the subdirectory */jobs*.

### Future development
Embed a `flexdashboard` document inside a `workflowr` analysis.
In doing that we would have a versioned dashboard which can be useful in some situation.

## 3. Scheduler

**OK. But how do we automatize `R` scripts? Once again, we have to define a proper `.yml` file.**

First of all I decided to place all the `R` scripts I want to schedule under the
subdirectory *.github/workflows*, in case I needed to trigger more actions in the future.

### Set up API *secrets*

An essential and preliminary step is to set up `ARDUINO_API_CLIENT_ID` and `ARDUINO_API_CLIENT_SECRET`,
so that `Rduinoiot` package will be able to retrieve the data through the API.
Since we want them to be secret, we cannot send them together with the `refresh-data.R` 
script. 

**Github** allow us to define environments where the jobs will run and inside
these environments we can define the so called `secrets`.
For doing that, go to *Settings* > *Environments* > *New Environment*, chose a name 
for your environment and click *Configure environment*. Scrolling down the 
configuration page you will see:

<div style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
![](images/environment-secret-add.png)
</div>

Then you need to choose a name for your *secret* and fill in the value. 
Once you have done, going to *Settings* > *Environments* you will see your new environment
with 2 *secrets*.

<div style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
![](images/environment-secret-added.png)
</div>

### `schedule-commit.yaml`

We will now see separately each part of the `.yml` file but  [here](https://github.com/FlavioLeccese92/Rduinoiot-analysis/blob/main/.github/workflows/schedule-commit.yaml){target="_blank"} you can find the full script.

1. We give a name to the action and we tell `github actions` when the script needs
to run. In this case we scheduled every 15 minutes but also we want it to run 
every time a new push occurs on *main* branch, so we will make sure to have 
a potential quick failure after changes.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
name: rduinoiot-jobs
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "*/15 * * * *"
  push:
    branches:
    - main
```

2. We define our jobs. In our case, a single job named **refresh-data** (with 2 `R` scripts).
We tell **Github** to run the job on a macos system and on the environment called
*rduinoiot-jobs-environment* on **Github** where we stored our `secrets`.
Furthermore, under *steps* we use `actions/checkout@master` (documented [here](https://github.com/actions/checkout/){target="_blank"}), `r-lib/actions/setup-r@master`
which installs and sets up `R` ([here](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/setup-r/){target="_blank"})
and `r-lib/actions/setup-pandoc@v2` which installs **pandoc**, needed to knit `rmarkdown` 
([here](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/setup-pandoc/){target="_blank"}).


```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
jobs:
  refresh-data:
# The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: macos-latest
    environment: rduinoiot-jobs-environment
# Load repo and install R
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@master
    - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-pandoc@v2
```

3. Now we need to import `ARDUINO_API_CLIENT_ID` and `ARDUINO_API_CLIENT_SECRET`
*secrets* from *rduinoiot-jobs-environment* into `.Renviron` where `R` will be
able to retrieve them, allowing to use `Rduinoiot`'s functions.
To check if everything is going well, we print the content of `.Renviron`.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Load API key into Renviron
    - name: Load API key
      env:
        ARDUINO_API_CLIENT_ID: '${{ secrets.ARDUINO_API_CLIENT_ID }}'
        ARDUINO_API_CLIENT_SECRET: '${{ secrets.ARDUINO_API_CLIENT_SECRET }}'
      run: |
        touch .Renviron
        echo ARDUINO_API_CLIENT_ID="$ARDUINO_API_CLIENT_ID" >> .Renviron
        echo ARDUINO_API_CLIENT_SECRET="$ARDUINO_API_CLIENT_SECRET" >> .Renviron
        echo "cat .Renviron"
        cat .Renviron
      shell: bash
```

4. Almost there. We install packages required by the two `R` scripts and run them!

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

# Install R packages
    - name: Install packages
      run: |
        install.packages(c("Rduinoiot", "dplyr", "tibble","lubridate"), repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
        install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "flexdashboard", "echarts4r", "htmltools"), repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
      shell: Rscript {0}
# Run R refresh-data
    - name: Run refresh-data
      run: Rscript jobs/refresh-data.R
# Run R deploy-dashboard
    - name: Run deploy-dashboard
      run: Rscript jobs/deploy-dashboard.R
```

5. Finally we commit all the new files created with this process.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Add new files in data folder, commit along with other modified files, push
    - name: Commit files
      run: |
        git config --local user.name actions-user
        git config --local user.email "actions@github.com"
        git add --force data/*
        git commit -am "GH ACTION Headlines $(date)"
        git push origin main
      env:
        REPO_KEY: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
        username: github-actions
```

<center><font size="5">**...and we `R` done !**</font></center>

# Conclusions

We learned how to exploit the combined power of [**Workflowr**](https://workflowr.github.io/workflowr/){target="_blank"},
[**Flexdashboard**](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/){target="_blank"} and [**Github actions**](https://github.com/features/actions/){target="_blank"} in order to deploy
on **Github** a live dashboard for free, showing
[**Arduino Opl√† Iot kit**](https://opla.arduino.cc/){target="_blank"}'s sensor values.
We used [**Rduinoiot**](https://flavioleccese92.github.io/Rduinoiot/){target="_blank"}
to easily retrieve data.
The dashboard is available [**Rduinoiot**](https://flavioleccese92.github.io/Rduinoiot-analysis/weather-report.html/){target="_blank"} or clicking on the tab of this site *Weather report*.

</div>

### Future development
Having real time weather data may be not that useful by itself. For this reason I
am planning to dig into the **prediction** mode! The idea is to exploit weather
stations placed nearby my house by [**Arpae**](https://www.arpae.it/){target="_blank"},
the *Regional agency for prevention, environment and energy of Emilia-Romagna* (Italy).
Since weather stations provide real time data but, disgracefully, not in a real API 
mode, I need to derive some workaround. In fact, **Arpae** allows user to get data
through a [**web service**](https://simc.arpae.it/dext3r/){target="_blank"} which,
when queried data of interest, sends the data to an email.

The idea is to automatize this procedure by sending the request and reading the 
data from email's attachment. The `R` will be scheduled as an additional *job*
called by **Guthub action** and I will be able to attempt weather predictions üöÄ
